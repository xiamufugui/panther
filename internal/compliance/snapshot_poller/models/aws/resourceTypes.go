// Exported set of ResourceTypes. This export was initially created to provide a hardcoded set of

// NOTE! - This hardcoded data set is found in several places in our code base.
// Until this data is sourced from a single location you need to check if any additions
// or modifications to this data need to coincide with updates in the other places where this data
// is hardcoded.
//
// Locations may not be in this list! right now this data is hardcoded in
// • internal/compliance/snapshot_poller/models/aws/ResourceTypes.go
